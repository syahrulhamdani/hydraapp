# Hydra AI

## Elevator Pitch

Presenting complex data to a mixed audience can feel like fighting a multi-headed monster.
The CTO wants technical details, while the CEO just wants the bottom line.
If you ignore either one, your pitch fails

Introducing Hydra: The first AI role-play agent designed to help data professionals master the multi-stakeholder meeting.
It integrates ElevenLabs' Conversational AI and Google Vertex AI to simulate a 'two-headed' (or even multi-headed) audience.
It listens to your pitch in real-time and dynamically switches—from a demanding Business Executive to a skeptical Engineer—interrupting you the moment you lose the room.
Don't just practice your speech; learn to tame the boardroom beast.
